I conducted a research project on employees a company employed during the 1980s and 1990s, using six CSV files from the employee database of that period. I began by designing tables to store the data from these CSV files and created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to plan the database structure. After that, I imported the data into a SQL database to enable structured querying and analysis. This involved data modeling to define relationships and constraints within the data, ensuring its integrity and usefulness. Once the data was imported and modeled, I performed data engineering tasks to clean and integrate it, preparing it for detailed analysis. Finally, I analyzed the data to answer specific questions about the employees from that era, extracting meaningful insights into the workforce dynamics of the 1980s and 1990s at the company.
