I conducted a research project on employees from the 1980s and 1990s at a company, using six remaining CSV files from that era's employee database. 
I began by designing tables to store the data from these CSV files.
Next, I imported the data into a SQL database for structured querying and analysis. I performed data modeling to define relationships and constraints within the data, followed by data engineering tasks to ensure data quality and integration. 
Finally, I analyzed the data to answer specific questions about the employees and derived meaningful insights.
